Data Visualization using Tableau

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis:
### The main goal of this project was to visualized data extracted from [Citi Bike trip history data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html). The bike trip analysis were done using these data. Pandas was also used to convert "tripduration" parameter into datetime data type. A set visualizations was done to:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results

- The graphs shows the breakdown of trip duration by gender. Most bike riders who identified themselves as "male" are higher in number than the other categories. It can also be said that "female" and "unkwown" riders tend to take longer trips than "male" riders."
